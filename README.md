# DataStructuresShip

Introduction:
Emergencies at sea happen more often that one would expect, and the automation of simple data could save time, lives and assets. This is the case of this project: Provide, in a fast way, the information of the closest port to a boat, based on the user's judgement of the closest latitude.
The world map presented is an introduction of what is gonna be done, so one can visualize all the ports in the world and understand the feeling of making a fast choice in a crisis time. Close to the end, there are a few questions for the user, which will return name of a port, latitude, and longitude. The closest port will be based on the user's latitude choice, which should be made according to the user's observed gps location.

Data Source: For this analysis I used data provided by IMO (International Maritime Organization).

Purpose: To use Python language - Data Structures. In this project you will see a binary tree and a hash table.

Libraries: Pandas and Geopandas.
